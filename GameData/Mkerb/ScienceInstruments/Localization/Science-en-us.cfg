		#MKERB-Rad-NolasInSpace  = Maybe some space junk is cause for wrong readings
		#MKERB-Rad-NolasSrfLanded  = This place should be named Kukushima.

		#MKERB-Rad-TitanusInSpace  = The radiation is dangerous here

		#MKERB-Time-KerbinInSpaceHigh  = As you get farther away from Kerbin, time passes every so slightly faster than normal. Future instrumentation will be built to account for this.
		#MKERB-Time-MunInSpace  = As you approach the mass of the Mun, time is beginning to dilate again.
		#MKERB-Time-MunSrfLanded  = Time dilation definitely correlates with gravitational pull and velocity.
		#MKERB-Time-MunFlyingLow  = Time is slowly getting faster again as gravity overtakes orbital velocity.
		#MKERB-Time-MunFlyingHigh  = The clock spins wildly out of control! Oh, no, wait, you just have it wired incorrectly.
		#MKERB-Time-MinmusInSpace  = You could've sworn that the clock just whispered that it loves you.
		#MKERB-Time-MinmusSrfLanded  = There's no effect on the passage of time. Probably because Minmus has a very small mass.
		#MKERB-Time-GillyInSpace  = Really? Did you really expect that a body of this size would dilate time? Learn how to physics.
